# SonicDNA

**Advanced sonic genome project**  
*A next-generation audio format and generative audio model built on actual coded DNA datasets for every sound imaginable. Smaller than MP3, quality as good as WAV, and truly new ways to synthesize and store sound.*

## üöß Project Status: Planning Phase

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is currently in the planning and prototyping stage.**
>
> - The ideas, architecture, and folder structure are being laid out now.
> - **No functional audio encoding, generation, or DNA agents are implemented yet.**
> - This repo is being used to solidify the design, version control early experiments, and invite feedback as the groundwork is laid.

## Vision

SonicDNA will eventually provide:
- **Sonic DNA encoding:** Efficient, lossless representation of sound structure
- **AI-based generative audio:** Not just ‚Äúguesswork‚Äù‚Äîdata-driven, code-based synthesis
- **Modular agent pipeline:** Multiple feature-extraction and validation agents for dense audio analysis
- **Pro-grade tooling:** GUI, CLI, and batch orchestration for easy experiments

---

## Current State

- [x] Modular folder/project structure defined
- [x] Basic GUI and PySide6 skeleton
- [ ] Audio DNA extraction agents (**not implemented**)
- [ ] DNA-to-audio generative engine (**not implemented**)
- [ ] Rule-based validation and dataset building (**not implemented**)
- [ ] Audio compression experiments (**not implemented**)
