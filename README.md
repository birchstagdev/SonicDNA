# SonicDNA

**Advanced sonic genome project**  
*A next-generation audio format and generative audio model built on actual coded DNA datasets for every sound imaginable. Smaller than MP3, quality as good as WAV, and truly new ways to synthesize and store sound.*

## üö¶ Project Status: Rule Definition Phase

> üö© **Major Update (June 2025): Core rulesets for audio DNA sequencing are now complete!**
>
> - All primary variable rules and serialization formats (see `rules_*.json`) are now fully specified.
> - These rules form the backbone for future audio DNA extraction agents, generators, and format encoders.
> - Functional implementation of DNA agents, audio encoding, and the generative engine are next.

## Vision

SonicDNA will eventually provide:
- **Sonic DNA encoding:** Efficient, lossless representation of sound structure
- **AI-based generative audio:** Not just ‚Äúguesswork‚Äù‚Äîdata-driven, code-based synthesis
- **Modular agent pipeline:** Multiple feature-extraction and validation agents for dense audio analysis
- **Pro-grade tooling:** GUI, CLI, and batch orchestration for easy experiments

---

## Current State

- [x] Modular folder/project structure defined
- [x] Basic GUI and PySide6 skeleton
- [x] **Audio DNA variable rulesets complete (`rules_*.json`)**
- [ ] Audio DNA extraction agents (**not implemented**)
- [ ] DNA-to-audio generative engine (**not implemented**)
- [ ] Rule-based validation and dataset building (**not implemented**)
- [ ] Audio compression experiments (**not implemented**)

## Audio DNA Rulesets

A full set of JSON files‚Äîone for each major audio property‚Äînow defines the "genome" for audio DNA sequencing.

**Find them in the repo as:**  
`rules_Volume.json`, `rules_Frequency.json`, `rules_Clarity.json`, `rules_Timbre.json`, `rules_Envelope.json`, `rules_Dynamics.json`,  
`rules_Emotion.json`, `rules_Macro_Intensity.json`, `rules_Perceived_Pitch.json`, `rules_Noise_Texture.json`, `rules_Wavelength.json`,  
`rules_Texture_Complexity.json`, `rules_Harmonicity.json`, `rules_Transients.json`, `rules_Phase_Spatial.json`, `rules_Resonance_Damping.json`,  
`rules_Glide_Slur.json`, `rules_Effect_Artifact.json`, `rules_Formant_Structure.json`

Each file:
- Defines precise encoding/decoding structure for its audio property
- Documents all sub-variables, data ranges, padding, and serialization order
- Will be directly used by future agent scripts for feature extraction, validation, and synthesis
